    "NUMPY: One of the trickier things to manage when working with matrices and vectors is making sure their dimensions align properly. Numpy actually takes a lot of that work out of the process by supporting something called broadcasting which makes the process easier and the code easier to read. using Numpy's arrays can be 10 times faster than Python's lists. To enable the speed, Numpy arrays are fixed in size unlike lists which can change in size."
